# Main Objective
This repository houses a number of single-function scripts that were borne out of necessity by myself or my colleagues while conducting Anthropological Research. 

Each `.R ` script starts with a description that provides information about how each argument is used and should be formatted.

To use any of these functions, copy-and-paste the function script, run it, and you should be good to go.

If you run into any errors or issues that you cannot figure out, or have any suggestions to improve these functions, please feel free to email me at: [elainechu@nevada.unr.edu]

Enjoy!
